# Lab 1: Getting Started with Snowflake

**Time**: ~20 minutes

## What You'll See

| Feature | Why It Matters |
|---------|---------------|
| **Role Creation** | Create roles with different privileges in seconds |
| **Separation of Compute** | Multiple warehouses for different workloads |
| **Instant Resizing** | Scale up/down with zero downtime |
| **RBAC** | Simple GRANT statements control access |

## Quick Start

1. Open Snowsight and create a new SQL Worksheet
2. Copy/paste `lab1_complete.sql`
3. Run each section and observe the results

## Key Takeaways

- **Roles are intuitive**: `CREATE ROLE` + `GRANT` = done
- **Warehouses are independent**: BI and ETL don't compete for resources
- **Resizing is instant**: No downtime, no migration
- **Pay for what you use**: Auto-suspend saves money
